LogAider
========

##Description
Todayâ€™s large-scale supercomputers are producing
a huge amount of log data. Exploring various potential correla-
tions of fatal events is crucial for understanding their causality
and improving the working efficiency for system administra-
tors. To this end, we developed a toolkit, named LogAider,
that can reveal three types of potential correlations: across-
field, spatial, and temporal. Across-field correlation refers to
the statistical correlation across fields within a log or across
multiple logs based on probabilistic analysis. For analyzing
the spatial correlation of events, we developed a generic, easy-
to-use visualizer that can view any events queried by users
on a system machine graph. LogAider can also mine spatial
correlations by an optimized K-meaning clustering algorithm
over a Torus network topology. It is also able to disclose the
temporal correlations (or error propagations) over a certain
period inside a log or across multiple logs, based on an effective
similarity analysis strategy. 

This code corresponds to the paper published in CCGrid2017: "LogAider - A tool for mining potential correlations in HPC system logs".

##Dependency

LogAider is coded in Java, so you need to install JDK 1.8+
(checking the version of JDK on your machine using 'java --version')

After installing JDK, you are ready to use LogAider by running the corresponding bash scripts or the java programs.

##How to use LogAider

LogAider provides a rich set of analysis functions as listed below, for mining the correlations of events in a Reliability, Availability and Serviablity (RAS) log.
In the following, we use the RAS log of MIRA supercomputer (BlueG/Q system) as an example. We provide flexible schema files for users to edit, in order to adapt to other systems. 

- **Extract all warn and fatal messages from original log**
> *script*: CollectWarnFatalMessages.sh  
*source code*: analysis.RAS.CollectWarnFatalMessages.java  
*Usage*: java CollectWarnFatalMessags [schemaPath] [severity_index] [file or directory: -f/-d] [logDir/logFile] [log_extension]  
*Example*: Example: java CollectWarnFatalMessags /home/fti/Catalog-project/miralog/schema/basicSchema.txt 4 -d /home/fti/Catalog-project/miralog csv  

*schema file* is used to specify the format of the log data. For example, in MIRA RAS log, the basicScheme.txt looks like this:  

```
#Column 		name    schema  	Data type name  Length

CPU			SYSIBM  INTEGER 	4       0       Yes  
COUNT			SYSIBM  INTEGER 	4       0       Yes  
CTLACTION		SYSIBM  VARCHAR 	256     0       Yes
MESSAGE			SYSIBM  VARCHAR 	1024    0       Yes
DIAGS			SYSIBM  CHARACTER       1       0       No
QUALIFIER		SYSIBM  CHARACTER       32      0       Yes
```

In the above example, /home/fti/Catalog-project/miralog is the directory containing the original RAS log data files, whose extensions are csv.  
Some examples are showns below:
