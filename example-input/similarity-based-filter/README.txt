This folder contains the final filtered fatal events based on the similarity-based algorithm (details can be found in our CCGrid17 paper).

keyIndexClass.conf contains the setting of the weights on different attributes. 

The two delay thresholds are set to 240 seconds and 43200 seconds, respectively.

The file allEvents.txt-0.3.cor means that the similarity-threshold was set to 0.3.
